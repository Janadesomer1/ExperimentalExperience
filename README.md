## Storyline
Astronaut Marshall takes you back to his own childhood. Everybody always told him he
was never going to be an astronaut because he suffers from astma. But he proved
everyone wrong and now he want to encourage anyone else suffering from astma to never
let go of their dream, no matter how impossible it may seem.

## Goal of this experience
Our target group for this experience is for kids who suffer from astma. But ofcourse
anyone who's interested can use this website. We created it because we wanted these kids
to be able to practice their lung capacity in a playfull and fun way. Breathing out
to the maximum capacity helps with getting more fresh air. And with this common exercise
the diaphragm is used to an even better extend.
